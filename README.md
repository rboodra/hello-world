# hello-world
This is my initial repository
Rattan here. This is my first attempt at programming after 20+ years. My initial exposure to programming was with Fortran 77 and C in my undergraduate program in 1999. 
My decision to try this is due to delays in the IT department providing the necessary support to develop simple functional web pages for my department. So I thought I would make an attempt at it.
